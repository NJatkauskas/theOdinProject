    <h1>Amazingly Tasty and Crispy Chicken Schnitzel</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A schnitzel is a thin slice of meat. The meat is usually thinned by
      pounding with a meat tenderizer. Most commonly, the meat is breaded before
      frying. Breaded schnitzel is popular in many countries and is made using
      veal, pork, chicken, mutton, beef, or turkey. Schnitzel is very similar to
      the dish escalope in France, tonkatsu in Japan, cotoletta in Italy, kotlet
      schabowy in Poland, milanesa in Argentina, chuleta valluna in Colombia and
      "chicken fried steak" of the Southern United States.

        <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
        <p>
          Whisk eggs, honey, Dijon mustard, soy sauce, and garlic together in a

      <li>
        <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
        <p>
          Heat 1/2 to 1 inch of vegetable oil in a heavy skillet to 350 degrees

      <li>
        <p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
        <p>
          Put chicken slices in the egg mixture and knead until fully coated.
